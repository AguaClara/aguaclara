## Describe the Missing Coverage
*What code isn't currently tested but definitely should be? Is a new `test_<>.py` file needed or can these tests be added to an existing one?*

## Expected Behavior
*A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen (or code).*

## Recommended Fix
*What is the most straightforward way to fully and appropriately test the feature.*
